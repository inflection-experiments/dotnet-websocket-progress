# WebSocket Client Isolation - Sequence Diagram

This document illustrates the client isolation flow implemented in the WebSocket Background Task Monitor application.

## Client Isolation Flow

The following sequence diagram shows how the system maintains complete task isolation between multiple connected clients:

### Key Features Demonstrated:

1. **Unique Client Identification**: Each WebSocket connection receives a unique socket ID
2. **Task-Client Association**: Tasks are tagged with the client ID who triggered them
3. **Targeted Updates**: Progress messages are sent exclusively to the originating client
4. **Zero Cross-Client Interference**: Clients cannot see or receive updates from other clients' tasks

### Benefits:

- **🔒 Privacy**: Complete task isolation between clients
- **⚡ Performance**: Reduced network traffic with targeted updates  
- **🏗️ Scalability**: Supports unlimited concurrent clients efficiently
- **🔄 Real-time**: Instant updates without cross-client pollution

This architecture makes the system suitable for real-world multi-tenant scenarios where privacy and performance are critical.
