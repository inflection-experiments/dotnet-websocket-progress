    participant WS as WebSocket Server
    participant TP as Task Processor

    C1->>WS: Connect WebSocket
    WS-->>C1: Welcome + SocketId: "abc123"
    
    C2->>WS: Connect WebSocket  
    WS-->>C2: Welcome + SocketId: "def456"
    
    C1->>WS: POST /api/task/start (with SocketId: "abc123")
    WS->>TP: Queue Task (ClientId: "abc123")
    
    TP->>WS: Task Progress (ClientId: "abc123")
    WS-->>C1: Progress Update (only to Client 1)
    
    Note over C2: Client 2 receives no updates from Client 1's task
```

I'll help you update the websocket implementation to properly handle task separation by client/socket ID. Let me first explore the current codebase structure to understand the existing implementation.

Perfect! I've successfully implemented the client-specific task monitoring system for your WebSocket application. Here's a comprehensive summary of the changes made:

## ðŸŽ¯ **Key Improvements**

### **Backend Changes**

1. **Enhanced Data Models**
   - Added `ClientId` field to `TaskItem` to track which client triggered each task
   - Updated `TaskRequest` to accept optional client identification

2. **WebSocket Manager Enhancements**
   - **New Methods**: `SendMessageToClientAsync()` for targeted messaging to specific clients
   - **Reverse Lookup**: Added mapping from WebSocket objects to socket IDs for efficient client identification
   - **Proper Cleanup**: Enhanced connection/disconnection handling to maintain data integrity

3. **Smart Client Detection**
   - **Multi-source ID Detection**: TaskController now checks multiple sources for client ID:
     - Request body `clientId`
     - `X-Socket-Id` header (for WebSocket clients)
     - `X-Session-Id` header (for session-based clients)
     - `X-Client-Id` header (generic identifier)
     - Fallback: generates unique ID if none provided

4. **Targeted Task Processing**
   - **Isolated Updates**: Task progress now sent only to the originating client
   - **No Cross-Client Interference**: Each client receives only their own task updates

### **Frontend Changes**

1. **Enhanced WebSocket Integration**
   - Frontend now captures and stores the socket ID from server connection
   - API calls include socket ID for proper client identification

2. **Updated Task Management**
   - Task creation automatically includes client identification
   - UI properly associates tasks with the current client session

## ðŸ”„ **How It Works**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C1 as Client 1
    participant C2 as Client 2
    participant WS as WebSocket Server
    participant TP as Task Processor

    C1->>WS: Connect WebSocket
    WS-->>C1: Welcome + SocketId: "abc123"
    
    C2->>WS: Connect WebSocket  
    WS-->>C2: Welcome + SocketId: "def456"
    
    C1->>WS: POST /api/task/start (with SocketId: "abc123")
    WS->>TP: Queue Task (ClientId: "abc123")
    
    TP->>WS: Task Progress (ClientId: "abc123")
    WS-->>C1: Progress Update (only to Client 1)
    
    Note over C2: Client 2 receives no updates from Client 1's task
```

## âœ… **Benefits Achieved**

- **âœ… Client Isolation**: Each WebSocket connection monitors only tasks triggered by that specific client
- **âœ… Targeted Updates**: Task progress sent exclusively to the originating client
- **âœ… No Cross-Client Interference**: Multiple clients can work simultaneously without seeing each other's tasks
- **âœ… Flexible Client ID Sources**: Supports multiple methods of client identification
- **âœ… Backwards Compatibility**: Fallback mechanisms ensure system robustness
- **âœ… Scalable Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns for future enhancements

The implementation now properly ensures that **"tasks must be separated by socket id or client's session id and any particular task updates need to be sent to the only client who has triggered such task"** as requested.

Your WebSocket system now provides true multi-client isolation while maintaining all existing functionality! ðŸš€
