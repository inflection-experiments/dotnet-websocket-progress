   - Ping/pong for connectivity testing

2. **Background Task Processing**:
   - Channel-based queue for high performance
   - Hosted service for continuous processing
   - Progress tracking with real-time updates
   - Concurrent task execution

3. **Modern Frontend Architecture**:
   - Svelte 5 with latest runes syntax
   - SvelteKit 2.x with SSR
   - TypeScript for type safety
   - Reactive state management

4. **Developer Experience**:
   - Hot reload for both frontend and backend
   - Comprehensive logging
   - Easy setup with automated scripts
   - Clear project structure

## 🚀 How to Run

### Quick Start (Recommended)
```bash
# Unix/Linux/macOS
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh

# Windows
start.bat
```

### Manual Setup
```bash
# Backend
cd backend
dotnet restore
dotnet run

# Frontend (new terminal)
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Access Points
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:5000
- **WebSocket**: ws://localhost:5000/ws

## 🧪 Testing the Implementation

1. **Start both services** using the quick start scripts
2. **Open the frontend** in your browser
3. **Verify WebSocket connection** (should auto-connect with unique socket ID)
4. **Create tasks** with different names and durations
5. **Monitor real-time progress** updates (only your tasks visible)
6. **Test multiple concurrent tasks**
7. **Test multi-client isolation**:
   - Open multiple browser tabs/windows
   - Start tasks in different tabs
   - Verify each tab only shows its own tasks
8. **Test connection resilience** by stopping/starting the backend

## 📊 Features Demonstrated

✅ **Asynchronous Background Processing**: Tasks run in the background without blocking the API  
✅ **Multi-Client Task Isolation**: Each client only sees and receives updates for their own tasks  
✅ **Client-Specific WebSocket Updates**: Progress updates sent only to the originating client  
✅ **Flexible Client Identification**: Support for Socket ID, Session ID, Custom ID, and fallback generation  
✅ **Queue Management**: Tasks queued efficiently using .NET Channels  
✅ **Connection Management**: Auto-reconnection, ping/pong, connection status with unique IDs  
✅ **Server-Side Rendering**: SvelteKit SSR for better SEO and initial load  
✅ **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation  
✅ **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices  
✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling and user feedback  
✅ **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging  
✅ **Development Tools**: Hot reload, watch mode, easy setup  
✅ **Scalable Architecture**: Clean separation for multi-tenant scenarios  

## 🛠️ Architecture Highlights

- **Backend**: Clean Architecture with separation of concerns
- **Frontend**: Modern component-based architecture with reactive state
- **Communication**: REST API for commands, WebSocket for client-specific real-time updates
- **Data Flow**: Client Request + ID → Queue → Background Processing → Targeted WebSocket Updates
- **Client Isolation**: Tasks separated by client ID with no cross-client interference
- **State Management**: Svelte stores for reactive state management
- **Error Boundaries**: Comprehensive error handling at all levels

## 🔐 Client Isolation Implementation

### Key Technical Innovation

The most significant feature of this implementation is **true multi-client task isolation**:

**Problem Solved**: Traditional WebSocket applications broadcast updates to all connected clients, creating privacy issues and unnecessary network traffic in multi-user scenarios.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Unique Client Identification**: Each WebSocket connection receives a unique socket ID
- **Task-Client Association**: Every task is tagged with its originating client ID  
- **Targeted Messaging**: Progress updates sent exclusively to the task creator
- **Zero Cross-Client Interference**: Complete isolation between different clients

**Architecture Benefits**:
- 🏗️ **Scalable**: Handles unlimited concurrent clients efficiently
- 🔒 **Secure**: Complete privacy between client sessions  
- ⚡ **Performant**: Reduces network traffic with targeted updates
- 🧩 **Flexible**: Multiple client identification methods supported
- 🔄 **Real-time**: Instant updates without cross-client pollution

This client isolation architecture makes the system suitable for **real-world multi-tenant scenarios** where privacy and performance are critical.
